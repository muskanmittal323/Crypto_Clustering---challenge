# Cryptocurrency Clustering with K-Means

This project involves the application of K-Means clustering to cryptocurrency data to identify distinct groups based on their market characteristics. The process includes data normalization, optimal cluster number determination (value for *k*), clustering with K-Means, and optimization with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Preparation Steps

### Data Normalization

1. Normalize the data using `StandardScaler()` from scikit-learn.
2. Create a DataFrame with the scaled data. Use "coin_id" from the original DataFrame as the index.

```python
# Code snippet example for normalization
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assume df is your original DataFrame
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df.drop('coin_id', axis=1))
scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(scaled_data, index=df['coin_id'])


### Re-evaluating the Best Value for k Using PCA Data
Repeat the elbow method with the PCA-transformed data to find the potentially updated optimal k value.
Discuss any differences in the optimal k value compared to the original data.
Clustering with PCA Data
Cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data with the updated best k value.
Visualize the clusters with scatter plots and interpret the results.

### Questions and Answers

What is the best value for k? (Answer after using both original and PCA data)
What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?
Does the best k value differ between the original and PCA data?
What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
